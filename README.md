# Neural-Network-Example-in-R
One vs all neural network example with RELU hidden layer.

Credit for the following functions in this repository goes to David Selby (source: https://selbydavid.com/2018/01/09/neural-network/):

feedforward, backpropagate, train

I have modified these functions myself to create and experiment on different types of neural networks.
